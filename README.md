# Demo API automation using PyTest


[![Python API Test Demo](https://github.com/brian-dev/pytest_api/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brian-dev/pytest_api/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

## Project Overview
This demo project is based on a simple notes web app. The application consists of both a UI and an API, with this 
repository focusing specifically on the API side of the application. The Notes API consists of the three major 
functional areas: an endpoint to check overall system health, a collection of User endpoints for managing users and a 
collection of endpoints for managing Notes. The test suite consists of positive and negative cases for each endpoint, 
as well as some cases where boundary and/or edge conditions were applicable. 

## Project Setup
First, clone the[ core-python](https://github.com/brian-dev/core-python) framework. Change directories in to the 
**core-python** directory. From a terminal run the following commands:\
`python repo_cli.py`
Select the `Python API` option
