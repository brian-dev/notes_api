# Demo API automation using PyTest


[![Python API Test Demo](https://github.com/brian-dev/pytest_api/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brian-dev/pytest_api/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

## Project Overview
This demo project is based on a simple notes web app. The app was designed for the sole purpose of learning and/or 
practicing software automation. The application consists of both a UI and an API, with this repository focusing 
specifically on the API side of the application. The Notes API consists of the three major functional areas: an 
endpoint to check overall system health, a collection of User endpoints for managing users and a collection of 
endpoints for managing Notes.
